      "Over 15 years experience with enterprise application integration and web development, in Java and .NET environments ranging from startups to the Fortune 500.  Recent experience with microservice architecture supporting tens of millions of users and over 100 terabytes of data.",

      "I am highly comfortable with major Java frameworks including Spring, Hibernate/JPA, Apache Camel, and Akka.  Familiar with JEE, as well as ASP.NET on the Microsoft side.  I have worked with practically every major application server, and have recent experience with deploying microservices in Docker containers.",

      "More than a decade of experience with messaging middleware, from MQSeries on midrange servers to RabbitMQ on commodity hardware.  Deep knowledge of HTTP-based EAI approaches such as SOAP and REST / HATEOAS.",

      "Strong background in relational data modeling, and performance considerations for major database vendors (primarily Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL).  Recent NoSQL experience with Cassandra and ElasticSearch at high scale.  Limited exposure to Hadoop and Spark for batch data processing and analysis.",

      "I've worked with HTML/CSS and JavaScript for over 15 years.  I am extremely comfortable with jQuery, and have more recent experience with AngularJS and TypeScript.",

      "Excellent oral and written communication skills.  I've been active in Toastmasters International (a public speaking organization), and interact well with business stakeholders.  I have a background in teaching training classes, and deeply enjoy mentoring junior developers.",

      "I'm a published author, maintain a technical blog at StevePerkins.com with 5-10 thousand unique visitors per month, and am also a guest blogger for JavaCodeGeeks.com.  My GitHub account is “steve-perkins”, where I keep a number of open source personal projects and code samples."

        "We use a microservice architecture, with Google services written in Java and hosted on Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft services written in C# and deployed to Azure.  Service integration primarily involves AMQP (i.e. RabbitMQ) and REST.  We are in the process of shifting to Docker - based containerization of microservice components across the board.",

        "Responsible for design and ongoing code reviews for one to two development teams of roughly 5 members each.  Individual mentoring is emphasized, along with periodically giving group presentations at our weekly lunch-n-learn sessions.",

        "Beyond ongoing design and code reviews, architects are charged with short-term “spike projects”, to prototype new features or implement major system re-writes.  My particular areas of specialty have been batch processing, messaging middleware, and Big Data.",

        "I introduced BigQuery (i.e. Google’s answer to Hive or Pig running over Hadoop or Spark) into our stack for offline reporting and data analytics.",

        "Drove research and proof-of-concept projects exploring self-hosted alternatives to the Google Cloud Datastore.  We eventually landed on the Apache Cassandra distributed database, in use on the Microsoft side today.",

        "In two major concurrency-related initiatives, I re-wrote our sequential batch processing framework with multithreaded Java, and reimplemented our Java-based proxy microservice using Golang.  Throughput and costs were reduced by an order of magnitude in both cases."

I was selected as the first developer to be embedded with the consulting firm bootstrapping the migration. I was responsible for driving business and technical requirements, and mentoring other internal developers as they incrementally moved over from legacy development.",

        "Integrated the new Hybris platform with in-house and third-party services (e.g. sales tax calculation, salary verification) using RabbitMQ and Spring AMQP.",

        "Made heavy use of jQuery, and lighter use of AngularJS, in the front-end UI.",

        "Outside of the commerce platform, I designed a system based on Spring Batch for standardizing most of the company’s batch processing needs. For some special batch processes that need to be multithreaded, I used Scala and its Akka-based actor pattern.",

        "Expected to mentor less experienced developers. Initiated a monthly “lunch-n-learn” series, where I presented on various topics and eventually coaxed more introverted developers toward presenting on topics themselves."
